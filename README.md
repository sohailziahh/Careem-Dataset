# Careem-Dataset
Careem provided this dataset in a recent hackathon where the problem was to predict the destination of the user when he opens the app and the app would then book a ride in a blink of an eye.   One-click booking makes things faster and easier for the customer, and knowing where a customer would like to go next – even before they tell us – allows us to improve our service by ensuring the busier areas have a greater supply of transport options.  The Careem data science team asked the question, “if we build a supervised machine-learning  model to solve this problem, what are the most important and informative features needed to predict where a user goes?”
